Sudoku Solver
The Sudoku Solver is a Python-based desktop application that allows users to input a Sudoku puzzle and find its solution instantly. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter for intuitive puzzle input and display. It uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle efficiently.

Features
Interactive GUI: Input Sudoku puzzles directly using an easy-to-use grid interface.
Real-time Feedback: Displays the solved puzzle or notifies if the puzzle is unsolvable.
Validation: Ensures the correctness of the solution using Sudoku rules.
Error Handling: Automatically handles invalid inputs or empty cells.
How It Works
Input the Puzzle:
Users fill in the Sudoku grid by typing numbers (1-9) into the cells.
Leave empty cells blank or fill them with 0.
Solve the Puzzle:
Press the "Solve" button to compute the solution.
Display Solution:
The solved puzzle replaces the input in the grid. If the puzzle has no solution, an error message is displayed.
Technologies Used
Language: Python
Libraries:
Tkinter: For creating the GUI.
tkinter.messagebox: For displaying error messages.
Algorithm: Backtracking is used to systematically explore all possible solutions until the correct one is found.
