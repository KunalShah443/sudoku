Project Description: Sudoku Solver with GUI in Python
Overview
This project is a Sudoku solver application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python's Tkinter library. The application allows users to input their own Sudoku puzzles into a 9x9 grid and then solve them with a click of a button. The solution is displayed directly on the GUI, providing a user-friendly and interactive experience.

Project Features
User Input: Users can enter a Sudoku puzzle directly into the 9x9 grid.
Solve Button: A "Solve" button that, when clicked, processes the user input, solves the puzzle, and displays the solution.
Error Handling: If no solution exists for the given puzzle, an error message is displayed.
How It Works
Initialization: The main window is created, and a 9x9 grid of entry widgets is set up where users can input their Sudoku puzzle. A "Solve" button is also provided.

Reading Input: When the user clicks the "Solve" button, the application reads the inputs from the grid, converts them into a 2D list representing the Sudoku board, and ensures all inputs are valid numbers between 1 and 9.

Solving the Puzzle: The application uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle. The backtracking approach systematically tries to fill the grid with valid numbers, backtracking whenever a conflict arises, until a solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

Displaying the Solution: Once the puzzle is solved, the solution is displayed back on the 9x9 grid. If no solution is found, an error message is shown.
